BETA - level of price fluctuations in relation to the benchmark,
i.e. 30 biggest stocks in XYZ

BETA = 1 volatility in security's price is similar to volatility
         of XYZ market
BETA > 1 security's price tends to be more volatile than the market
         (e.g. high tech stocks); if you accept more risk, than a
         broad market;
BETA < 1 security's price tends to be less volatile than the market
         (e.g. utility stocks); buy if you don't like risk
BETA = 0 cash has a beta of 0
BETA < 0 highly unlikely, some claim gold and gold related stocks
         should have negative betas
BETA > 4 highly unlikely for stocks of well-known companies

We calculate BETAs regressing returns of a given stock against
a benchmark return (30 biggest companies, equal-weighted).
We use rolling regression using weekly returns and rolling window
of 50 data points (weekly returns)

BETA is a historical measure of stock's riskiness!!!!!!
This tells us nothing about the future. Only if we believe
the future will resemble the past, can we use BETA in our
investment decisions.

Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in their paper"The Cross-Section
of Expected Stock Returns" [1992, Journal of Finance] say
that past beta is not a good predictor of future beta for
stocks. They find that higher betas tend to fall back towards
one and lower betas tend to rise towards one (mean-reversion of
betas)

BETA is a measure of systematic risk, i.e. risk that the market
as a whole faces. Beta, found by comparing the volatility of a
stock to the index, takes into account only the effects of
market-wide risks on the stock.
Firm-specific risks are not fully accounted for in BETA.
BETA gives investors a good idea about how changes in the market
affect the stock. Hence if an event occurs, that is about
the whole market, BETA is a good measure of risk inherent in such
events. But it doesn't tell us much about riskiness of
firm-specific events, e.g. missing earnings estimates.

In other words BETA does not incorporate new information.
A stock may be considered a defensive stock (low beta), but
it misses quarterly profit estimates and BETA will not incorporate
this new event quickly.
This is where we should introduce some measures based on
news (news suprises over last 2 years)

R2
A statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund
or security's movements that can be explained by movements in
a benchmark index.

R2 values range from 0 to 100 (%). An R2 of 100
means that all movements of a security are completely explained
by movements in the index. A high R2 (between 85 and 100)
indicates the fund's performance patterns have been in line with
the index. A fund with a low R2 (70 or less) doesn't act
much like the index.

R2 vs BETA
A higher R2 value will indicate a more useful beta figure. For
example, if a fund has an R2 value of close to 100 but has a beta
below 1, it is most likely offering higher risk-adjusted returns.
A low R2 means you should ignore the beta.
